 About project:
 Animations in web portfolios are a fantastic way to enhance the user experience and make your portfolio more visually appealing. Here are some concepts and techniques you can use to add animations:

1. Page Load Animations

Use animations to introduce your content when the page loads.
Example: Fade-in or slide-in effects for headings, images, and sections.


2. Hover Effects

Add subtle hover animations for buttons, links, and cards to improve interactivity. Example: Scale up a button or change its color when hovered.


3. Scroll Animations

Animate elements as they enter the viewport while the user scrolls. Example: Parallax scrolling, where background images move at a different speed than the foreground content.


4. Transition Effects

Smoothly animate changes between states. Example: Use CSS transitions for changing the appearance of menu items or toggling dark mode.


5. Micro-Interactions

Small, delightful animations for user actions like clicking a button or filling out a form. Example: A button briefly shrinks and expands when clicked.
